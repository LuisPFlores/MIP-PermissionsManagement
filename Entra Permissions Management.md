# Entra Permissions Management Delivery Guide

## Overview
Microsoft Entra Permissions Management is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities – users and workloads – actions, and resources across cloud infrastructures and identity providers. It detects, right-sizes, and monitors unused and excessive permissions and enables Zero Trust security through least privilege access in Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GCP.
